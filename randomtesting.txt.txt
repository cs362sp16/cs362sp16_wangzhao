base on the results of test, the coverage of smithy is 100%. 
the randomtestcard1.out shows:
Lines executed:100.00% of 5
Branches executed:100.00% of 2
Taken at least once:100.00% of 2
Calls executed:100.00% of 2

i set 100 times for test loop and i feel the random test will have higher coverage than the unit test becase it almost cover check all conditions(by using random variable) for the card that we want to test.
however, the unit test will not use random variable and it might check some specific case inside of random case. As a result, the unit test may not have the higher than the random test. 
i think the random test will have better fault detection capability because it almost test all the possibility of the case
