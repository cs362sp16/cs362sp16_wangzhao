i use the diffdominion to test my work with myself. and use different seeds to test and the result shows "test passed" and the coverage are the same. 

i also test my work with my classmates however the test result shows "test failed"

when i test my work with my classmates. 
it shows the coverage of my :
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:42.29% of 558
Branches executed:50.12% of 417
Taken at least once:32.13% of 417
Calls executed:26.32% of 95

i think this is because the run time is less than 20 times and i might miss some function for testing

and the test for my classmates:
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:63.20% of 559
Branches executed:67.60% of 417
Taken at least once:52.57% of 417
Calls executed:55.74% of 94
Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'
