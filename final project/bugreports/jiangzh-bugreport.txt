After runing the test there exist a bug in council_room_function(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos) line 1282 dominion.c

line 1285 - 1286 shows
for(i=0; i<3; i++)
      drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

however in the council-room  it should draw 4 cards

it should be i<4 not i<3
