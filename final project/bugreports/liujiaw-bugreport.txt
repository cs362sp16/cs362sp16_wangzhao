After runing the test there exist a bug in int my_Village(int handPos, int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state) at line 673 in dominion.c

line 679 shows 
state->numActions = state->numActions + 1; //2

which add one action however the village should add two actions

so the statement should be state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;
